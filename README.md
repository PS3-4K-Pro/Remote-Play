## Instructions  

1. **Disable your computer's antivirus software.**  
   Ensure it is completely disabled before proceeding to avoid potential interruptions during installation.  

2. **Adjust compatibility settings for the installer.**  
   - Right-click on `Remote Play Installer.exe` and select **"Properties"**.  
   - Navigate to the **"Compatibility"** tab.  
   - Enable **Compatibility mode** and select **"Windows 7"** from the drop-down menu.  
   - Click **"Apply"**, then close the window.  

3. **Install Remote Play.**  
   - Open `Remote Play Installer.exe` and follow the installation prompts to install the program.  

4. **Replace specific files in the installation folder.**  
   - Copy `rmp_dll.DLL` and `Remote Play Launcher.exe` to the installation folder for Remote Play.  
     By default, this folder is located at:  
     `C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony\Remote Play with PlayStation 3`.  

5. **Create a shortcut for easy access.**  
   - Right-click on `Remote Play Launcher.exe` and select **"Create shortcut"**.  
   - Use this shortcut to launch Remote Play whenever needed.  

6. **Re-enable your antivirus software.**  
   - If you disabled your antivirus earlier, turn it back on.  
   - You may need to create an exception for `rmp_launcher.EXE` to prevent it from being flagged.
